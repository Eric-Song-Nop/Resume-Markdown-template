### <span>Research Assistant in VDI center </span> <span>Dec 2020 -- present</span>

[Visual and Data Intelligence Center](http://vic.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) focus on computer vision and computer graphics. My current topic in VDI is about monocular full body human motion capture with audio assistance.

## Projects

### <span>A Taste of CNN Based Gaze Estimation</span> <span>Dec 2020</span>

  - A CNN based gaze estimation with almost SOTA accuracy developed with PyTorch.


### <span>SPH Based Fluid Simulation with Rigid Body Two Way Coupling </span> <span>Dec 2020</span>

  - Incompressible SPH based fluid simulation with two way coupling with a cube.
  - Spatial hash spped up and boundary sph particals for rigid body simulation.
  - Implemented in pure C++ and offline rendering with blender.

### <span>COOL compiler </span> <span>Dec 2018</span>
  - Implementing a compiler with lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation to MISP.
  - Basic semantic and syntax analysis are done and support object oriented programming with inheritance

### <span> A star plane fighting game </span> <span>Dec 2020</span>
  - A star plane fighting game developed with unity which has cool space ship fighting part and space station communication part.
  - The game fully supports Xbox 360 controller and localized for both Chinese and English with XML.
  
### <span>Full body motion capture with sound assistance(In progress) </span> <span>2020 - present</span>
 - This project aims to assist data-driven monocular camera full body human motion capture with sound input.
 - Comparing to traditional monocular 2d motion capture, this project aims to enhance the performance and also the visual effects with the audio and input as assistance.
